# Sandbox for User account
Testing grounds for spring security 

## Updates:
This one turned out to be bit more than just a sandbox. Included Bootsrap for a decent looking frontend, and added functionality with spring security etc.

### Note:

For some reason, current configuration for userdetails is not working with Spring Boot version 2.6.0.
I've included a working solution if I ever decide to use newer Boot versions.
